### Unnoficial Cacti template repo

this repo has templates that I have began to currate from the Cacti Forums
Some of these I have created my self as well and update as needed 
I have not tested all of these but the ones that I have I will note down 


If you have templates you would like to contribute let me know 

For all Cacti related support questions check out the cacti forums 

[Cacti Forums](https://forums.cacti.net/) or the cacti github page [Cacti Github](https://github.com/Cacti)


### Not all of these templates have been tested in cacti 1.2.x except the Cisco templates (Tested by me)
It would be awesome to get all these tested and updated as needed to get them working
